CIO's have been given a mandate to move as much infrastructure as possible to the cloud.
Hybrid Cloud environments have become the norm.
While this allows companies to stop investing in obsolete datacenters and take advantage of additional computing capabilities it also increases the complexity of trying to secure critical data in the cloud and on premise.
Automation and Artificial Intelligence must be embraced as current approaches do not scale.
The Nation State actor has changed the threat landscape and now our adversaries have almost unlimited resources and computing power.
We must rethink our approach and stop trying to protect the perimeter and start with protecting the data.
Encrypted data is useless to cybercriminals inside or outside of your perimeter.

"My name is Maggie Kessenich and I love innovation  from watching how a brand can disrupt  or create  an industry	 to seeing how technologies have reinvented my daily patterns or simply nudging me to question the status quo."
